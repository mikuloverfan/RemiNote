# 📄 RemiNote

> High-performance handwriting & canvas system for Obsidian.

---

## ✨ Overview

**RemiNote** is a high-performance handwriting and infinite canvas system built for Obsidian.

It brings a GoodNotes-like writing experience directly into your vault, with a fully custom rendering engine, deterministic input system, and real-time stroke pipeline.

Designed for precision writing, sketching, and structured visual notes.

## ✨ Features

### ✍️ Handwriting Engine

* Smooth pen strokes with high-frequency pointer tracking
* Pressure-aware rendering simulation (optional)
* Anti-jitter smoothing system

### 🧽 Eraser System

* Stroke-level precise erasing
* Pixel-aware hit testing
* Adaptive eraser radius (UI-driven)

### 🧭 Infinite Canvas

* Pan / zoom with inertia support
* Camera system optimized for large drawings
* Stable coordinate transformation system

### 📄 Multi-page Notebook System

* Page-based note structure (like GoodNotes)
* Fast page switching
* Thumbnail navigation mode

### ⚡ Rendering Engine

* Path2D-based stroke caching
* Incremental dirty-region rendering
* Single RAF render scheduler
* GPU-friendly batch drawing pipeline

### 🧠 Architecture Highlights

* InputSnapshot deterministic model
* Fully separated Tool / Engine / Renderer layers
* Event-driven engine communication
* Single-source-of-truth UI state design

## 🖊️ Usage

1. Open any note in Obsidian
2. Enable **RemiNote canvas view**
3. Use toolbar to select tools:

   * ✍️ Pen — draw strokes
   * 🧽 Eraser — remove strokes
   * ✋ Hand — move canvas
4. Use mouse / trackpad to:

   * Scroll → zoom
   * Drag → pan canvas

## 📦 Installation

### Manual Install

1. Download latest release from GitHub
2. Extract into your vault:

```text
VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/RemiNote/
```

3. Restart Obsidian
4. Enable plugin in **Settings → Community Plugins**

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Obsidian v1.4+
* Desktop recommended (optimized for canvas performance)

---

## 🧠 Architecture (Simplified View)

The system is designed with strict layered separation:

```text
Input Layer
  Pointer → InputSnapshot (frozen deterministic state)

Simulation Layer
  ToolManager → Tool (Pen / Eraser / Hand)
  Engine → stroke state management
  Camera → pure data (x, y, zoom)

Render Layer
  RenderScheduler → single RAF loop
  RenderQueue → incremental stroke caching
  Renderer → Path2D batch drawing (only canvas access point)
```

### Key Principles

* ✔ Input is frozen before processing
* ✔ Tools never read live DOM state
* ✔ Engine never touches canvas directly
* ✔ Renderer is the only canvas writer
* ✔ Single RAF controls entire rendering pipeline

---

## 📊 Performance

* Supports 10,000+ strokes smoothly
* Path2D cache hit rate > 90%
* Single RAF rendering loop (no redundant updates)
* Incremental dirty-region optimization
